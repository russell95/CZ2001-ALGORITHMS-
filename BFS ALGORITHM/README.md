This assignment demonstrates a Shortest Path Algorithm using Breadth First Search.

This example is based off an airport network system, where given a number of available airports a user can specify a source and destination
and the program will run a shortest path algorithm to identify the best possible route to traverse to the desired location.

To files are used to make this program possible, first the GenerateGraph.java uses an adjacency matrix to populate different variations
of airport terminals of increasing variety. Then the Graph.java file will allow the user to input a source and destination terminal for
which the algorithm will display the shortest path.
